## What is LeetCode-Canvas

LeetCode-Canvas is a browser extension tailored for LeetCode users, providing a built-in drawing tool to visually map out coding problems. Integrated directly into the LeetCode problem page, users can access the tool with a simple click (located at the top right of the page). This extension eliminates the need to switch between tabs or external paint applications, allowing users to draw and annotate their thought process directly alongside the problem.

Visualizing problems is a widely recommended technique in the coding community. Since LeetCode doesn't offer its own drawing tool, LeetCode-Canvas fills this gap by offering an easy, seamless solution.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: LeetCode-Canvas is designed with simplicity and focus in mind, ensuring users can concentrate on problem-solving without distractions.

- **Versatile Drawing Tools**: Includes a paintbrush with customizable colors and brush sizes, an eraser tool, undo/redo functionality, and a clear canvas option to reset everything with one click.

- **Image Upload**: Users can enhance their visual aids by dragging and dropping images directly onto the canvas.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: As a browser extension, LeetCode-Canvas works on any computer with a compatible web browser, making it accessible from anywhere.
